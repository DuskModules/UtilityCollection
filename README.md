# UtilityCollection
Utility Collection is a module containing many individual scripts of different categories, which aren't substantional enough to be put in their own module. Anything that doesn't provide a feature big enough to warrant a whole new module is dropped in here. It's the lowest end of the DuskModules framework. Everything else is built on top of this.

This, and other Utility modules, are critical for the DuskModules framework, a large modular framework providing a lot of features for faster and more powerful game development. Most bigger modules have a dependency on several utility modules, sharing a common code base for better integration with one another.

Aside from that, I hope that these modules can benefit others as it has helped me with my work every day.

> When using this module, make sure to **Star** this repository. I would appreciate it if you gave credits to **Eric van Gastel** somewhere in your product, but I won't hold it against you if you don't. That said; **these modules are not allowed to be sold anywhere!**

### Contents
These are the available modules in the UtilityCollection:
- Attributes provide extra functionality for customizing the Inspector GUI, without writing a custom editor script.
- ExtensionMethods adds methods to common objects such as float, string, GameObject, Color or Lists.
- General contains everything that doesn't really belong in any other category. It's a mix of anything.
- ValueUtility adds 'living values'. Usually float number that change over time with an update method.

You should really check out the documentation website for the full feature list, though.

## Installation
Before installing these modules, you should prepare a few project settings within Unity to accommodate the new files. As a side effect, this will make it easier for you to use Github for your Unity project.

Go to *Edit/Project Settings*, then to the *Editor* tab. Swap *Version Control Mode* to *Visible Meta Files*, and *Asset Serialization* to *Force Text*. This will ensure all objects and references are pushed in a safe way, avoiding complicated conflicts in prefabs and scenes or loss of asset references.

### Import
There are three ways to install it, depending on your personal preference.

You can setup a submodule in your repository, making it easier to stay updated with the latest version:
```
$ git submodule add https://github.com/DuskModules/UtilityCollection Assets/DuskModules/1-UtilityModules/UtilityCollection
```

You can download and import the **UtilityCollection.unitypackage** into your Unity Project. (TODO: Add package release branch)

Or you can go to the UtilityCollection Asset Store page and download it from there. (TODO: Add AssetStore page)

## Demo & Documentation
There is an unity package available called **DemoPackages.unitypackage**. Import the contents if you want to check out the demo scenes and examples of the module functionality. You can always delete the demo folders without causing conflicts or errors.

# DuskModules Framework
The DuskModules framework contains numerous modules, each providing a distinct feature for game development in Unity. Some modules are open-source, and shared on github by https://github.com/duskmodules. All modules are also available on the Asset Store, though some are exclusively available for a small price, and cannot be downloaded from Github.

The framework is organised by 4 distinct categories of modules:
- Utility, provides programmer and developer assisting scripts
- Tech, provides large technical features such as input or data handling
- Game, provides core gameplay mechanics and effects, such as health and weapon systems
- MetaGame, provides long-term progression game mechanics such as levels or achievements

### State of Development
A transparent development process shows everyone how certain improvements and new features are coming along, and allows other people to chip in their opinion and expertise, resulting in more useful software for everyone.

## Contact
Send me a mail at info@dusklightstudios.com if you have any questions about the use of the DuskModules.

### Feedback
I'd love to hear back from you if you're using a module. Let me know what you're working on, and where the modules might need some work. I'll do my best to improve it to make it the best of the best.

> If you are releasing or have released a project using any DuskModule, send me a message! I'll share your project on all social media I can reach to promote both our work.
